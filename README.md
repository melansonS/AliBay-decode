# AliBay

Alibay is a full-stack marketplace web app that I built along side three of my colleagues at Concordia's Full-Stack Web Development program. It includes features such as; search and filter, purchase/sales histories, add to/remove from cart and product ratings.

Built using React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Multer, HTML and CSS.
